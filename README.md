## Code building for workflow package

This repository will be used to build a customized UConn PMF-SCS workflow for DIA proteomics data. The code will pull heavily from the MSstats package, but will be expanded to include more options for users, and more detail explanations of the steps in the analysis process. 

Main areas include:

* Data preprocessing: getting data from Spectronaut
* Data transformation: options for transforming abundance data
* Data filtering: provides options to filter out data based on preset levels 
* Data normalization: normalization procedures
* Data imputation: missing data procedures
* Data summary: calculating and presenting numerical summaries in tabular form
* Differential Abundance Analysis: statistical tools for DIA data analysis
* Data visualization: providing clean visuals to aid in data analysis decisions
