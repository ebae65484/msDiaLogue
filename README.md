# PMF-SCS-workflow


## Code building for workflow package

This repository will be used to build a customized UConn PMF-SCS workflow for DIA proteomics data. The code will pull heavily from the MSstats package, but will be expanded to include more options for users, and more detail explanations of the steps in the analysis process. 

Main areas include:

* Data preprocessing: getting data from Spectronaught
* Data transformation: options for transforming abundance data
* Data normalization: normalization procedures
* Data imputation: missing data procedures
* Differential Abundance Analysis: statistical tools for DIA data analysis
* Data visualization
