\item{reportImputing}{A boolean (default = FALSE) specifying whether to provide a
shadow data frame with imputed data labels, where 1 indicates the corresponding entries
have been imputed, and 0 indicates otherwise. Alters the return structure.}
}

\itemize{
\item If \code{reportImputing = FALSE}, the function returns the imputed 2d dataframe.
\item If \code{reportImputing = TRUE}, the function returns a list of the imputed 2d
